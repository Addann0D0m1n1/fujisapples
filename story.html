        <h1>Fuji's Apples</h1>

The master awoke before the sun rose.
Looking out, he saw the mouth of his cave hosting a pale inviting gray.
He stepped from his chamber onto the plateau to behold the bright black above.
His eyes twinkled with the infinite complexity of the distant horizon, and his being swelled with wonder.
He sat immediately on the spot, folding himself into the lotus position, and closed his eyes, turning inward to meditate. 
He quickly became nothing as his mind dissolved his body into the ground.
The disciples, having finally arrived, and having slumbered in the grasses and the canopies far below, were rubbing a long sleep from their eyes.
As the valley bathed gradually in the new sunlight, atop the plateau the disciples beheld a figure. 
It existed only as a silhouette against the blinding vision that had come upon the sky. 
Though the form was distant, they could see that it was like them.
Awed, they gathered in the many gardens of the valley under the mountain. 
Sinking to the ground, the many folk then attempted to shape themselves like what they saw above.
The first day passed like this, and the sun crossed the sky.
The master opened his eyes to behold the verdant valley, and the vast gathered pupils reflecting him. 
It was the first people he had ever seen.
He rose quickly in startled emotion, and immediately turned back to the familiarity of the cave.
His mind was turning with the knowledge of what he'd seen. 
Though they were distant, he could see that they were like him.

On the seventh day the master awoke in a dream. 
Looking out, he joined with the sun as it sat in space, and surmised his body ought to awaken soon as well.
He pondered the pale inviting gray of the mornings prior, and the nature of the light that had inevitably come. 
Opening his eyes, he turned to the mouth of the cave, and allowed its gentle light to infuse his being.
He took the steps from his chamber onto the plateau to behold the glorious bright black above. It was, as always, obscure, vivid, and unending.
He had, just that night, dreamed of the distant horizon's infinite complexity-- but, to be beneath it like this-- it was mezmerizing. His being welled with wonder.
He was overtaken at once by gravity, and sat quickly into the lotus position, closing his eyes to meditate.
It took him a few moments, but he soon became nothing as his mind dissolved his body into the ground.
The disciples, already awake and excited in the dark valley below, had beheld the master rising that morning as a silhouette against the morning's pale gray.
They gathered outside the nests and along the paths of the gardens of the valley beneath the mountain of the sun, looking up towards the plateau in anticipation. 
It was there, the form that was like them, above. Sturdy and enduring.
And then, rising like! Like! There! Warmth.
As it had all the days before; the sun gave its gift.
And it sat in the sky, like the figure that was like them sat atop the plateau. 
So they would rise, too, and they would sit.
The master's eyes were closed, but he thought of the people from the days before. Were they there?
Were they gathered like before?
He would see.
By the time he had welled the courage to open his eyes, the sun was setting.
But, there! Look!
Below, gathered, seated in lotus like him. As far as he could see.
An ocean.
He rose, bowed slowly over the valley, and turned back to the cave.
His mind was soft and oozing, like sap that would become amber.

On the nine-hundred-thousandth day, the master did not sleep.
He sat, instead of recessed in his chambers, at the mouth of the cave, awake. 
The sun on the far side of the world had left the sky as clear and unobstructed as calm water. The infinite bright black was beheld above through it.
For a moment, the master felt aerated by this, as if he was floating. He did not sink into the ground, as he had before, but was now untethered in the cold night. 
Fearful of becoming lost-- of floating away forever-- he returned to find himself in the lotus position atop the plateau outside his cave. The image in his mind was of a pale, inviting gray.
Suddenly, from behind and then over and above him there was a warmth and a light. The sun had risen. As it had.
Overtaken by the invigoration of life, and glad to be bounded by gravity, he stood up to stretch his wary limbs. Loosing an emptying sigh, his insides were free to be filled by the potent morning air.
The disciples below beheld the shining brightness overtaking the mountain, and the master's silhouette spreading to become a balance of five points.
It rose, so they would rise. It sat, so they would sit. 
Now it had spread wings.
The master looked below to see the valley erupting in color. The once still people had become vibrantly alive.
They twisted about, and seemed to spin too, as they grabbed hold and let go of eachother. They tangled and leapt, chasing and being chased.
The master was overjoyed, and moved like what he saw. The movements felt familiar, though he did not recall ever having moved in such a way.
The whole day passed like this.
Even in the moments where the master felt the need to rest, the people maintained their movements. And when some of the people grew tired still, others were moving elsewhere.
Tired, inspired, and alive, the master, after the relentless hours of festive motion, finally retired to his chambers to fall deeply asleep. 
His mind turned slowly, so exhausted from the day's festivity and celebration.
The day below was equally long, and merry, and though the master could not hear from his roost, the many dancing feet had birthed a chanting.
The people stayed up well into the evening that day, shrouded beneath the canopies singing songs and telling stories. 
They spent the night looking into eachothers eye's, and inventing dreams to make real.
All the people's minds were soft and oozing, like sap that would become amber.

This was new.
No light, but only a deep rhythm, coming from far away.
Where was the sun? It was no where.
But, this new thing. It was like light, but it was not light. 
He looked all around and could find none.
What was this new thing? Resonating.
Where was the pale, inviting gray? 
As he tried to open eyes that were found to not exist, he too found no breath to draw in, nor, indeed, any bellows to even fill.
Uncertain, he focused on what was there; the new thing.
It was a low hum, but became piercing and quick the more he focused on it. 
If he relaxed, it would subdue itself back to the mellow verb.
In a curious way, and after time experimenting, the master found a way to make contact the new entity via his intention. 
To modulate the balance of lowered subductions and higher frequencied piercings with various packeted allowances of his focus in this new space-without-light.
He spent some time studying the intricacies of the craft, and, after a short while, but not before long at all, the master stood back to behold his work. 
A humming window of pale inviting gray, one that seemed to undulate and shimmer with calling invitation. The master reached out to touch his creation. 
He awoke in his chambers, opening his eyes to a sound.
The sun had already risen, the usual pale inviting gray was now instead a blinding white. 
A series of sharp notes coming in sporadic successions tore through him, stirring him into wakeful presence. 
Wake! Wake! Wake!  Now-Now-Now-Now-Now-Now-Now!
At the mouth of the cave there was a tiny silhouetted figured. It leapt about, making a ruckus with its sounds. 
It sang as the master approached the cave mouth, and it sang while it leapt from the master's way as he approached his seat atop the plateau.
It sang as it bounced up over his shoulder, and hovered, and landed about him as he sat down into his lotus. It sang as he closed his eyes. 
As he emptied himself of prior knowledge, the chaotic nature of the fleeting's message became more meaningful. It was nuanced, but purposeful. 
</p>
<p>
"Lord among 
the first! 
learned to 
fly! 
many have. 
now we 
sing. sang 
to wake 
you. slept 
so long.
our music!"
</p>
<p>
And with its exclamation the curious creature leapt up and dove into the valley calling its kin. Almost at once, the trees themselves responded in kind, lifting up from their posts in the earth. 
Colorful spread leaves of splendid design and complexity erupted in a panorama of volcanic rainbification. The valley itself was pouring into the sky like gravity had inverted itself on a whim.
The master's mouth opened wide in a gasp, and he rose from his seat atop the plateau in enamored awe. 
He did not know where to look-- in every direction the dancing trees had become one with the sky.
But! The trees! In truth, he saw, they stayed rooted as they were! 
What had come from them was an extension of themselves and not their fundamental nature. 
So curious, the limbs of the many peoples-- what they'd made amongst themselves and for eachother. 
And, indeed, they had learned fly.
Then, together, the airborne creatures called out their hymn. Each a different note, from a different place, some soft, some loud, some fluid, some sharp. 
Some called out with the tiniest of hollow little bodies that whistled, others hosted long, flute like structures that honked.
Many like groups swelled together and performed dynamic aerial maneauvres with expert precision. Others prefered solitary displays that were nonetheless filled with power and grace. 
Together, and alone, and as many parts of a whole, the symphony eventually dispersed into a varied wave of scattered dots across the infinite blue horizon.
</p>
<p>
For the first time, the master realized he was alive.
</p>

<p>*******<p/>

<p>
On the twelve-million, two-hundred and sixty-five thousand, three-hundred and eleventh day, the master was carried from the mouth of the cave.
His disciples wept as his form was delivered into the warm light of the morning sun.
The plateau and the valley were now one, the disciples having engineered philosophies and technologies to reach the master in all ways.
Is he dead, they asked themselves and eachother. Did we kill him with our ambition?
No, I don't think so. 
He is as he always was.
What do we do now?
Look, there is a cup of tea.
There is steam still rising from it.
